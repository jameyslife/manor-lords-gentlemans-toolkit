## 🎨 Example Walkthrough

You start with a classic campaign, feeling stuck at a certain point — one click in our dashboard, and you can boost wood and stone, randomize villager moods, or generate entire economic events powered by Claude’s AI. The adaptive dashboard morphs, showing deeper controls as you need them. You request a resource tweak; OpenAI provides narrative-driven tips and events matching your playstyle in your preferred language.

**Picture this:**  
- “I want twice the wood in Winter, and bandits to act less aggressively.” Easy — a few sliders, all visually updated, with AI suggesting story elements to keep things fair.  
- Want to test “what if” scenarios? Our scenario randomizer collaborates with Claude, generating unique playthroughs never seen before.  

Every feature is crafted to spark curiosity, empower learning, and inspire new tactics.
